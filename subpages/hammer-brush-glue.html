            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="introduction-section">
                <p>The Hammer, Brush & Glue Learning Centre website represents an important milestone in my journey as a
                    web developer. This project challenged me to conceive, research, and create a comprehensive website
                    from scratch. In this case study, I will examine the key aspects of the website's development
                    process, from ideation to execution, highlighting the strategies and techniques used.</p>
                <div class="introduction-img"></div>
            </div>
            <h2>Project Plan and Ideation</h2>
            <p>The primary objective of the Hammer, Brush & Glue Learning Centre website was to serve as a platform for
                informing parents about childcare classes and services tailored for children aged 5 to 9. This
                family-owned business places vital importance on creating a nurturing and caring environment, with
                friendly tutors ensuring the well-being of every child. The website was designed to showcase the
                curriculum, activities, success stories, and testimonials to build credibility and trust among potential
                parents.</p>
            <h2>Creating a Unique Brand Identity</h2>
            <div class="brand-section">
                <p>The name "Hammer, Brush & Glue" isn't just a catchy title; it's a unique story that captures the
                    spirit of the Learning Centre's classes. This name was carefully crafted by me to be recognisable,
                    memorable, and to stand out in a crowded market.</p>
                <div class="brand-img"></div>
            </div>
            <h2>Design and Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>The colour scheme of the Hammer, Brush & Glue website was accurately chosen to vibrate with children
                while aligning with the logo and main navigations. This palette adds visual appeal and prioritises
                accessibility with high contrast and readability. </p>
            <p>All website illustrations were personally crafted by me, using disproportionate shapes and playful lines
                to maintain a consistent, child-friendly atmosphere.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Wireframes and Responsive Design</h2>
            <div class="wireframes-section">
                <p>Creating a seamless user experience across various devices was a key focus. I used a simple
                    low-fidelity approach to visualise the website's layout on different screens, ensuring mobile and
                    tablet responsiveness up to 900px and an optimal desktop version from 901px.</p>

            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>To fulfil the project objectives, I leveraged HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, PHP, incorporating best
                practices in accessibility and SEO. Interactive features such as sliders and scrolling elements were
                integrated to present information in a user-friendly manner. A "go to top" button was added to ease
                navigation on the long, one-page website. For mobile users, I designed a collapsed menu icon to save
                screen space while maintaining interactivity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="implementation-img"></div>

        <div class="hbg-wrapper">
            <h2>Challenges and Learning</h2>
            <div class="challenges-section">
                <p>Through this project, I gained valuable insights into web development. I learned the importance of
                    balancing interactivity with user convenience, realising that excessive sliders on a one-page
                    website could potentially frustrate users. And it may be worth minimizing the user interface by
                    avoiding unnecessary clicks for quick access to information.</p>
                <p>One of the most significant challenges I faced was making a gallery slider responsive across all
                    platforms, particularly in managing the height of the parent container. I think JavaScript might
                    offer a solution for this issue, but I haven't cracked it yet. Due to a looming deadline, I resorted
                    to a less-than-ideal approach – I employed around seven Media Queries exclusively for the gallery
                    slider, and even then, it was not perfect. Perhaps more Media Queries could have helped, but I
                    hesitated to add more.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="conclusion-section">
                <p>The Hammer, Brush & Glue Learning Centre website has become a demonstration of my growth as a novice
                    web developer. Through strategic planning, innovative design, and a user-centric approach, the
                    website effectively informs parents, introduces trust, and showcases the Centre's unique offerings.
                    It reflects my commitment to creating engaging online experiences that resonate with users and
                    fulfil business objectives.</p>
                <p>This project is a prove that web development is an evolving journey. This challenge provided an
                    opportunity to learn, adapt, and improve my skills. The Hammer, Brush & Glue Learning Centre website
                    stands as evidence of my commitment to delivering user-focused, visually appealing, and technically
                    sound websites.</p>
